# Prescription-Database
This project was created for a school coursework and aims to demonstrate the creation of a prescription database and the implementation of several problem queries using SQL.

# Database Creation
The first step in this project is to create the PrescriptionDB database and several tables. The tables were created from a csv file and populated with contents of the csv file while retaining the names of the table. The tables created are:

Medical_Practice table
Drugs table
Prescriptions table
The creation and population of these tables is done using SQL commands. The details of these commands are provided in the project code.

# Implementation of Problem Queries
After creating the PrescriptionDB database and populating the tables with data, several problem queries were implemented using SQL. These queries include:

Querying for drugs in the form of tablets or capsules
Querying for the total quantity for each prescription
Querying for the distinct chemical substances
Querying for the number of prescriptions for each BNF chapter plus code
Querying for the most expensive prescription prescribed by each practice
In addition to these queries, five additional codes for implementation were included. These include:

Query to return the total quantity of each drug prescribed
Query to return the average cost of prescriptions for each practice
Query to return the number of prescriptions for each BNF chapter code
Query to return the average cost of prescriptions for each BNF chapter code
Query to return the total cost of prescriptions for each practice

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the creation of a prescription database and the implementation of several problem queries using SQL. It provides a good example of how SQL can be used to manipulate and analyze data in a database.
